Pav bhaji is a fast food dish from India consisting of a thick vegetable curry served with a soft bread roll.:yum:

Its origins are in the state of Maharashtra.:smiley:

Variants of the dish may use other bread varieties such as chapati, roti or brown bread.:hand_over_mouth:

The dish originated in the 1850s as lunchtime fast food for textile mill workers in Mumbai.:drooling_face:

Pav bhaji was later served at restaurants throughout the city.:thumbsup:

Pav bhaji is now available at different types of food providers, from simple pushcarts to formal restaurants. :bento:

It may be found outside of India.:plate_with_cutlery:
